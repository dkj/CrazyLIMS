# JupyterLite Seed Content

This directory is bundled into the local JupyterLite build that powers the ELN notebook viewer.
Add notebooks or supporting files here if the embedded Lab experience should ship with pre-loaded
examples. The build step copies the tree as-is into the `/ELN` folder inside the Lite contents
service.
