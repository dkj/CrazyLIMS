# Functional Requirements for an Integrated Research LIMS/ELN

## Scope & Principles
- Research-institute LIMS with **ELN**; supports **flexible research** and **standardized, SOP-driven services** from operational/core teams.
- **API-first**: all UI capabilities available via authenticated APIs for human and machine use.
- **Configurable over time**; minimal friction to add new assays, services, instruments, and data types.

## Primary Actors
- **Researchers/Analysts** (plan/record experiments; consume services/results)
- **Core Facility/Operations Staff** (execute standardized workflows/services)
- **Lab Managers** (capacity, scheduling, KPIs)
- **Automation/Robotics/Instrumentation** (data ingest, status, triggers)
- **External Collaborators/Clients** (request services, view results; optional)

## Core Functional Domains
1. **Samples & Inventory**
   - Unique IDs, bar/QR codes; chain-of-custody; parent/child lineage.
   - Storage locations/conditions; movement logs; expiry; pick/return workflows.
   - Reagent/consumables stock; lot/COA tracking; reorder thresholds.

2. **Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN)**
   - Rich entries (text, media, files, data); templates; tagging; search.
   - Linkage to samples, reagents, instruments, protocols, results.
   - Versioning, timestamps, authorship; optional witnessing/e-signatures.

3. **Service Requests & Workflow Orchestration**
   - Request submission (parameters, attachments, SLAs, due dates).
   - SOP templates → instantiated **tasks/steps** with gating, data capture, QC.
   - Work queues, assignment, priorities, status transitions, deviations/CAPA.
   - Result capture & delivery (files, reports, structured data); notifications.

4. **Scheduling & Resource Management**
   - Instrument/equipment booking; task/sample scheduling; capacity/skills.
   - Conflicts detection, reminders, rescheduling; calendar views.

5. **Data Management & Reporting**
   - Centralized repository for structured data & large files; lineage/provenance.
   - Search/query, dashboards, KPIs (TAT, throughput, utilization).
   - Standard and custom reports; exports (CSV/JSON/PDF); data retention policies.

6. **Integration & Automation**
   - **Machine interfaces**: REST/GraphQL, webhooks, file-watch ingest, sockets, vendor/cloud APIs.
   - Instrument runs → auto-ingest, parse, validate, map to entities.
   - Eventing for downstream pipelines/analytics; external tool interoperability.

7. **Security, Access, Governance**
   - RBAC/ABAC; project/tenant scoping; least privilege.
   - Audit trail of all reads/writes/approvals; immutable logs.
   - PII/PHI handling (if applicable); encryption in transit/at rest.

8. **Compliance (Optional/Configurable)**
   - Controls for GLP, ISO 17025, 21 CFR Part 11: e-signatures, auditability, SOP control, training/competency checks.

9. **Extensibility & Administration**
   - Low-code configurability for entities, fields, templates, workflows, forms.
   - Dictionary/ontology/vocabulary support; units and QC rules.
   - Environment promotion (dev/test/prod); migrations; seeded templates.

10. **Non-Functional Requirements**
    - Performance (p95 latencies defined per use case); horizontal/vertical scale.
    - High availability & backup/restore; disaster recovery objectives.
    - Observability: metrics, logs, traces, audit dashboards.
    - Usability: accessible, responsive UI; offline-tolerant data capture (optional).
    - API contracts with schemas; versioning and deprecation policy.
