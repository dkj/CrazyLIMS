# Overarching Implementation Plan

## Phase 0 – Environment & Governance
- Stand up devcontainer services for PostgreSQL, PostgREST, and PostGraphile.
- Add migration tooling and seed runners; wire CI to apply migrations and run smoke queries.
- Export OpenAPI and GraphQL SDL for contract snapshots as part of CI.

## Phase 1 – Core Schema & Security Backbone
- Model multi-tenant projects, users, roles, permissions, and audit tables.
- Implement RLS policies with JWT role mapping and immutable audit triggers.
- Seed baseline roles to align with operations, research, and external actors.

## Phase 2 – Samples & Inventory Domain
- Design tables for samples, aliquots, storage locations, chain-of-custody history, and reagent inventory.
- Add views/functions to expose lineage trees and stock thresholds.
- Auto-generate REST/GraphQL endpoints and verify with sample workflows.

## Phase 3 – ELN & Data Capture
- Create ELN entry tables with versioning, attachments metadata, and linking tables to samples/protocols.
- Integrate object-storage pointer pattern with checksums for large files.
- Expose templating APIs and configure low-code UI bindings for rich entry authoring.

## Phase 4 – Service Requests & Workflow Orchestration
- Define configurable SOP templates, task instances, step gating, QC outcomes, and CAPA tracking using declarative tables plus supporting functions.
- Add views for work queues and SLA monitoring.
- Ensure RLS isolates project data across workflows and tasks.

## Phase 5 – Scheduling & Resource Management
- Model instruments, calendars, reservations, and skill assignments.
- Create conflict-detection functions using exclusion constraints.
- Surface availability endpoints for UI scheduling components.

## Phase 6 – Data Management & Reporting
- Implement structured results storage (JSONB with schema validation), file linkage, and provenance references.
- Add materialized views and analytics surfaces for KPIs.
- Publish reporting endpoints and connect to dashboard tooling.

## Phase 7 – Integration & Automation Hooks
- Configure LISTEN/NOTIFY, webhooks tables, and ETL staging schemas.
- Wrap ingest stored procedures for instrument data and external APIs.
- Document event contracts and retention policies.

## Phase 8 – Compliance & Administration Tooling
- Parameterize optional GLP/21 CFR controls (e-signature states, training checks) with feature flags.
- Build configuration tables for vocabularies, units, and environment promotion.
- Script admin UI scaffolding in Retool/Appsmith.

## Cross-Cutting Focus Areas
- Testing: Add migration unit tests, PL/pgSQL function specs, and contract tests for generated APIs during each phase.
- Performance & Observability: Create index strategies, log/metrics tables, and monitoring hooks as domains land.
- Documentation & Enablement: Version schema diagrams, API changelogs, and SOP playbooks alongside each phase; regenerate client SDKs after migrations.
